        If you choose not to pay the initial investment cost and
        the final investment cost, the net earnings for that round
        will be zero. If that round gets selected for payment,
        your final earnings will not go up or down.
        If you choose to pay the initial and final investment
        costs, the earnings for that round will be determined
        by which payoff is chosen according to the stated probabilities.
        Specifically, if you decide to pay the initial and
        final investment costs, you will earn:
        0 – initial inv cost + payoff – final inv cost
